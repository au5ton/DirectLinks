# DirectLinks

Forked from the [original project](https://github.com/canisbos/DirectLinks), this repository is  or the Chrome port of the Safari extension by @canisbos. Periodically (or on request), the injected script will be pulled from upstream.

## Install

Install by using the CRX from the releases page or from the **[Chrome Web Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jmmlehkhepchhogkchmcmkedebfaebia/)**. The web store link might break because google is weird.

## About

*Description pasted from http://canisbos.com/directlinks*

> This extension circumvents certain techniques used by Google and Facebook to track link clicks.
> When you click a link in Google search results, Google uses JavaScript to replace the actual link with an indirect one, which they use for click tracking. Google then redirects the browser to the actual destination after logging the click. DirectLinks disables the JavaScript that replaces real links with indirect ones, so that when you click a search result link, Safari goes straight to the destination.
> The extension does something similar for links in Facebook posts: it removes JavaScript that Facebook uses to track clicks on these links.
